# ML Demo

PyTorch demo that I made so I could run it on my cheap laptop

## Required libraries
```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio termcolor matplotlib
```

## How to use

1. Run `python src/train1.py` until satisfied
2. Run `python src/train2.py` until satisfied
3. Run `python src/predict.py` to check results

The scripts save progress into files `trained_model` and `output.png`
